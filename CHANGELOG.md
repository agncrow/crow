# Changelog

Crow is in alpha: the syntax may change between releases, `crow fix`
migrates what it can, and a breaking change bumps the minor version.
Each release lists what breaks first. This file summarises; the commit
history says the rest.

## Unreleased

### Added

- The mark: the `(o.o)` every command prints, as `assets/crow.svg`, on
  the README, the book's pages (favicon, touch icon and top bar, their
  addresses versioned by the mark's own bytes) and the editor extension.

### Fixed

- The book site made its directory before writing a page, so a fresh
  checkout published every chapter; the Pages site had answered 404 for
  all but the front page and the specification.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-10-13

The first release of the alpha: the one-line install, and everything
since v0.5.0 (2026-09-06).

### Breaking

- `contains[xs, x]` and `has[m, k]` are written `x in xs`; `gather[…]`
  is `concat[…]`; `pad` and `append` are gone.
- One moment kind: `now`, `moment`, `fields` and `fmt[style = …]` replace
  `calendar`, `parse_time`, `datetime`, `tz` and `time[]`.
- `then` chains are written as lines.
- `nodes[n]` is retired: `crow launch n` starts the processes and
  `env['CROW_RANK']` names each.
- Map literals are `map[k = v]`; a map holds one kind of value; a map's
  keys have a kind (text or int).

### Added

- One line installs Crow: a prebuilt binary for macOS arm64 and Linux
  x86_64 from the release, verified; the interpreter, the tests and the
  servers need nothing else. `crow setup` (or the first `crow build`)
  fetches the pinned Rust toolchain and the runtime into `~/.crow`; with
  no compiler present, `crow run` says so and interprets.
- `use llm`: a language model as a connection (`reach`, `ask`, `chat`,
  `follow`, `embed`), tools as functions, over Anthropic's and the
  OpenAI-compatible wire formats.
- Request fixtures: `crow check --record-fixtures` keeps what a request
  answered, `crow test --fixtures` replays it in both modes with no server
  and no model.
- The HTTP client, the readers, S3, mail, WebSockets, `math.stats` and
  the ClickHouse and Postgres drivers written in Crow on the `sys` layer.
- Ints that grow past 64 bits, decimals and fractions; `use bits`.
- Packages held to a reference: `symbolic` (PySR), `models/boost`
  (scikit-learn), `graph` (networkx), `optimize` (scipy), `retrieval`
  (scikit-learn, rank_bm25), `gpt` (nanoGPT), `vectors` (faiss); the frame
  verbs held to pandas.
- The `rag` reference app; the error-message overhaul and `crow fix`; the
  rehearsal, the app baseline and the scenarios in `crow check`; routes
  reading the app's derivations.

### Performance

- Compiled programs at Rust's speed on the benchmarks game set; the
  interpreter on an instruction form with typed registers (fannkuch from
  77 s to 1.3 s); frames faster than before by 2 to 10 times and ahead of
  polars on load, sort, join and unique; TechEmpower plaintext at Rust's
  speed.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-09-06

The version the alpha starts from.
