# mcp

Tools from other programs, and a Crow program as one: the Model Context Protocol over Streamable HTTP — a server named, its tools listed and called, and a route answering as a server over the functions themselves.


Import with `use mcp`. Tools from other programs, and a Crow program as one: the Model Context Protocol, revision 2026-07-28 — stateless, every request carrying its protocol version and the client's capabilities in `_meta` — over both of its transports: Streamable HTTP, one POST per message, and stdio, a process the program starts and talks to one message per line. Written in Crow on `request` and the `sys` layer (design rule 20; `src/modules/mcp.co`), its functions its declaration (`server`, `discover`, `catalog`, `tool`, `answer`, `listen`); `crow test src/modules/mcp.co` runs its own tests, and `tests/mcp.rs` drives a Crow client against a stand-in server, a stand-in client against a Crow server, and a Crow client against a Crow server over stdio, in both modes. The design is docs/agents-design.md.

```
use mcp

s = server['http://localhost:8000/mcp']
log[catalog[s][0].name]                      --- the first tool the server offers
log[tool[s, 'weather', map[city = 'Lisbon']]] --- the text its result carries
files = server[command = 'npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp']
log[catalog[files][0].name]                  --- the same calls, the server a process
```

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---|
| `server[url = '', token = '', command = '']` | An MCP server as a connection: the URL of its MCP endpoint (`http://` or `https://`), and the bearer token its requests carry, if any — or, by name, the command that runs it over its standard streams (the stdio transport), as `shell[cmd]` takes a command: `server[command = 'npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp']`. A parsed value: `s.url`, `s.token`, `s.command`. An error value of kind `'mcp'` for a URL that names no endpoint, for a URL beside a command, for a token with a command (stdio takes its credentials from the environment, as the protocol says), and for nothing named | [Tools from other programs: `use mcp`](../by-example/mcp.md) |
| `discover[s]` | What the server says of itself (`server/discover`): `supportedVersions`, `capabilities`, its `instructions` for a model, and who it is under `_meta`; a parsed value | [Tools from other programs: `use mcp`](../by-example/mcp.md) |
| `catalog[s]` | The tools the server offers (`tools/list`): a parsed value list, each its `name`, `description` and `inputSchema`. A response streamed as events is read to its last message | [Tools from other programs: `use mcp`](../by-example/mcp.md) |
| `tool[s, name, given]` | A tool called with its arguments — a map, or a parsed value (`tools/call`) — answering the text its result's content carries. A result the server marks an error (`isError`) is an error value of kind `'mcp'` saying what it said, as is a tool the server does not have, a server that answers an error, and one nobody answers (over stdio: a process that ended, or wrote a line that is no message, `cannot reach the MCP server /bin/cat: the process ended`) | [Tools from other programs: `use mcp`](../by-example/mcp.md) |
| `answer[req, tools = [f, g], name = 'crow', instructions = '']` | The request a POST route was handed, answered as an MCP server over the functions themselves: `server/discover` with the versions, the capabilities and the instructions; `tools/list` with each tool's schema from its description (`describe`, sys — the comment above the function, its parameters by name with the kinds inference found); `tools/call` with the tool of the name applied to its arguments (`apply`), its value's text the result, a wrong argument or the tool's own failure a result marked an error, a name no tool has the protocol's `Unknown tool` error. A notification is accepted with 202; a body that is no JSON, a request missing its `_meta` or the headers the transport requires (`MCP-Protocol-Version`, `Mcp-Method`, `Mcp-Name`), and one of another protocol version are refused with 400 and the JSON-RPC error the protocol names (`-32700`, `-32602`, `-32020`, `-32022`); an unknown method with 404 and `-32601` | [Tools from other programs: `use mcp`](../by-example/mcp.md) · [The standard library's layer: `use sys`](../by-example/sys.md) |

| `listen[tools = [f, g], name = 'crow', instructions = '']` | The program as an MCP server over its own standard streams: every line of its standard input a message, answered on its standard output exactly as `answer` answers a route's request — the same `server/discover`, `tools/list` and `tools/call`, the same errors in the message (there is no status and no header over stdio: the body is the source of truth) — a notification answered with nothing, each answer written whole before the next line is read, until the input ends (an empty line ends it too: a message is never empty). Answers empty text. A program serving so writes nothing else to its standard output; its standard error is its own (`log` goes to standard output, so a serving program keeps its notes for standard error or a file) | [Tools from other programs: `use mcp`](../by-example/mcp.md) |

`discover`, `catalog` and `tool` reach the network through `request`, or a process through the layer's `send` and `recv`, and `crow check` sees the call. A program becomes an MCP server with one route:

```
use web, mcp

--- the current weather in a city, in °C
fn weather[city]
    r = request['https://wttr.in/`trim[city]`?format=j1']
    return str[json[r.body].current_condition[0].temp_C]

fn served[req]
    return answer[req, tools = [weather], name = 'weather-server']

route['/mcp', 'POST', served]
serve[8000]
```

**The stdio transport: a server is a process the program talks to.** `server[command = 'crow run tools.co']` names a server by the command that runs it. The process starts at the first message — `start[command]` (sys): `sh -c` runs the command with its standard input and output piped, as the protocol's client launches its server — and is kept for the program's life, one process per command, started again at the next message if it ended, as the transport says a client restarts a server that exited. Each request is one line on its input, with the `_meta` every request carries (the revision mirrors nothing into headers over stdio: there is no header layer), and the response the line on its output carrying the request's id — the ids count up on the process, so a late answer to an earlier request is passed over, as are the notifications a server writes before its response; a line that is no JSON message is refused with its words, since the transport forbids a server anything else on its output. The server's standard error is the program's own: the transport lets a server log there, and a client may forward it, which this one does. Ten minutes is the most a message waits, as over HTTP. A Crow program is such a server with `listen[tools = [f, g]]` in place of the route: the same answers, the same errors, over its standard streams; a legacy client's `initialize` is refused naming the revision spoken, as the revision asks of a modern-only server. The client is modern-only: it does not probe with `server/discover` before another request, and `discover` is the program's to call (the revision recommends probing to fail deterministically against a legacy server, which here fails with the server's own error instead).

```
use mcp

--- the current weather in a city, in °C
fn weather[city]
    r = request['https://wttr.in/`trim[city]`?format=j1']
    return str[json[r.body].current_condition[0].temp_C]

listen[tools = [weather], name = 'weather-server']    --- crow run weather.co, as a client's command
```

**Design Note: a module of its own, stateless as the protocol is.** Considered: the client inside `use llm`, since an agent is who calls a server's tools (rejected: a server needs no model, and `use llm` stays the one place a program reaches a model); the connection as a handle kind (rejected, as `reach`'s was: it holds a URL and a token's text, which a parsed value shows); the earlier revisions' `initialize` handshake and `Mcp-Session-Id` (rejected: the 2026-07-28 revision removed sessions, and a client sends one request and reads one answer, which is what `request` does; a legacy server answers 400 with no modern error, which the client names). Decided (2026-10-20): `use mcp`, the client on `request` with the headers the transport mirrors from the body, the server a function a POST route calls, the schema writer the same shape `use llm` writes for a model (a helper is a module's own, so each module writes it).

**Design Note: a process is a socket, and a server is named by its command.** The stdio transport (2026-10-20, docs/agents-design.md) needed a process held open. Considered, for the handle: a handle kind of its own, declared beside sys's rows (rejected: a kind is a `Value` variant, a `Kind`, an `Arg` and an arm in every rule that meets them — a compiler change, where the compiler is frozen — and a process is read and written as bytes, which is what a stream is); a stream (`start[command]` answering what `open` answers, rejected: a message is a line, and what a read takes past the line's end must stay with the process for the next read, which is what a socket holds beside its stream — so a process is a socket, as a WebSocket's connection is: `type[p]` is `socket`, `send`, `recv`, `leftover`, `unread` and `close` serve it, and nothing was added but `start`). Considered, for the surface: the transport inside the URL (`server['stdio: npx …']`, rejected: a parse hidden in text, and a URL that is none); a second export naming a command (`command['npx …']`, rejected: `server` is the one way to name a server, the transport an option); a program and a list of arguments, as the SDKs' configurations are written (`server[command = 'npx', args = ['-y', …]]`, rejected: a second way to write a command beside `shell`'s, and a list option with a `[]` default makes a copy of the function whose items have no kind) — decided: `server[command = text]`, the command as `shell` takes one, the shell's own quoting. Considered, for the handle's place: a record answered by `server`, holding the socket (rejected: `act` reads its servers as their JSON, since a list option's default `[]` has items of no kind, and a handle is no JSON); a process per message, the protocol being stateless (rejected: a server such as `npx …` takes seconds to start, and the transport says a client restarts a server only when it exits) — decided: the process is the runtime's, one per command under the program, found and started by `start` at every message, so `server[…]` stays a parsed value and the loop's `servers = [s]` is unchanged. Considered, for when it starts: at `server[…]` (rejected: `server` would be an effect for one transport and none for the other, and the shell starts `sh -c nosuch` as readily as a server, so nothing fails earlier) — decided: at the first message, where `crow check` sees the call. Its standard error is inherited: the transport lets a server log there and a client forward it, and a server's reason for ending is then where the program's own stops are. What the revision says of stdio (https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/basic/transports/stdio, read 2026-10-20): messages are newline-delimited JSON-RPC with no embedded newlines; the server may write anything to standard error and must write nothing but messages to standard output; request metadata is carried in the body's `_meta` alone, "there is no header layer"; the client ends the server by closing its input, waiting for it to exit, then forcing it, TERM before KILL on POSIX — and a server should exit promptly when its input closes; a client should restart a server that exits unexpectedly; a dual-era client probes with `server/discover` and falls back to `initialize` on any error that is not a recognized modern one, and a modern-only server should name the versions it speaks in its answer to `initialize`. The runtime's `close` and the restart follow it; the fallback is not built, since the client speaks one revision.
